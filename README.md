This project uses XMRIG CC by [Bendr0id](https://github.com/Bendr0id/xmrigCC)

# ‼️‼️IMPORTANT:
For Now the code only supports MONERO mining, if this gets attention il add other CPU intensive options for mining. OR you can edit the command.txt file yourself if you know what you are doing.


# 💻 Browser Miner Automation with Playwright

This project automates browser-based crypto mining using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) and Google account OTP-based login. It logs into a vulnerable platform, opens multiple tabs, and injects a safe JavaScript-based keep-alive script to maintain mining sessions.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔐 Auto-login using Gmail OTP (via Gmail API)
- 🚀 Multi-tab mining automation (customizable tab count)
- 🧠 JavaScript-based keep-alive system (safe & non-intrusive)
- 🔄 Command injection into terminal through the web interface
- 🧼 Email cleanup to avoid inbox clutter
- 💵 You Get approx 700-800 Hashrate on every TAB
- TO DO - More advance detections for inactivity, Better config optimization, aim for higher hashrate 

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Playwright 
- Gmail API credentials (`credentials.json`)
- Google API packages:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
- Install playwright browser binaries
  
## 📁 Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
  git clone (https://github.com/ismailalkaf/miner-automation.git)
  cd miner-automation
  ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  playwright install
  ```

3. **Set Up Gmail API**
   
  🟥 **NOTE** 
  **You will be giving the BOT full access to your gmail, so using alt gmail ID is highly preffered**
  
  1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
      - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
      
      - Click "Create Project" → give it a name (like “Gmail Login BOT”).
    
  2. **Enable Gmail API**
      - After project is created, go to "APIs & Services" > Library.
      
      - Search for "Gmail API" → Click Enable.

  3. **Create OAuth Credentials**
      - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
      
      - Click "Create Credentials" → OAuth client ID
      
      - Choose Desktop App.
      
      - Download the credentials.json file.
      
      - Rename it credentials.json and save it in the same directory


4. **Add Your Monero Wallet Address**
      - Use any wallet supported by nanopool.org,
        Open `command.txt` and edit the field (Your_wallet_address) with you own wallet address, there are 3 such fields

5. **Add your email**
      - Head to main.py and edit ("your_email") with the email you used for creating the cloud project

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python gmailcode.py
```
The script will:
  - Open up a google auth window
  - Select the account you used to create credentials.json
  - You may get an error of insufficent access, or the dev has not allowed you to access it
  - To fix this, Go to console.cloud.google.com
  - Open your project
  - Go to APIS
  - Then Go to OAuth consent Screen
  - Click on Audience
  - Under Test Users, Click on Add users
  - Fill the email you used for this project
  - Save
  - Now rerun `python gmailcode.py`
  - If Sucessfull, it should save a file named `token.json`

  - Now Run
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  - This will start the program and you should see chromium tab pop up and simulating the login process for you

**OPTIONS**
  - You can edit the num_tabs field if you want more tabs mining ( Do not exceed more than 90% ram consumption, as it may cause forceful inactivity)
  - To check mining progress, head to https://nanopool.org and enter your wallet address in the search field

  20 tabs being run

**NOTE**
**THIS IS AN EXPLOIT AND MAY STOP WORKING IF PATCHED**

## 🧠 How Keep-Alive Works

Instead of sending keystrokes, we inject the following safe JavaScript:
- Scrolls the page slightly up and down
- Focuses the terminal's hidden input field
- Dispatches an `input` event

This keeps the mining sessions alive without disrupting the actual terminal behavior.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your Gmail credentials are stored locally and securely.
- Never share `credentials.json` or `token.json`.
- Avoid using accounts with 2FA unless you're using app passwords.
