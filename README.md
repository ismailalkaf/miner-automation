# 💻 Browser Miner Automation with Playwright

This project automates browser-based crypto mining using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) and Google account OTP-based login. It logs into a vulnerable platform, opens multiple tabs, and injects a safe JavaScript-based keep-alive script to maintain mining sessions.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔐 Auto-login using Gmail OTP (via Gmail API)
- 🚀 Multi-tab mining automation (customizable tab count)
- 🧠 JavaScript-based keep-alive system (safe & non-intrusive)
- 🔄 Command injection into terminal through the web interface
- 🧼 Email cleanup to avoid inbox clutter
- 💵 You Get approx 700-800 Hashrate on every TAB
- TO DO - More advance detections for inactivity, Better config optimization, aim for higher hashrate 

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Playwright 
- Gmail API credentials (`credentials.json`)
- Google API packages:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
- Install playwright browser binaries
  
## 📁 Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AryanSLAYERRR/miner-automation.git
  cd miner-automation
  ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  playwright install
  ```

3. **Set Up Gmail API**
   
  🟥 **NOTE** 
  **You will be giving the BOT full access to your gmail, so using alt gmail ID is highly preffered**
  
  1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
      - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
      
      - Click "Create Project" → give it a name (like “Gmail Login BOT”).
    
  2. **Enable Gmail API**
      - After project is created, go to "APIs & Services" > Library.
      
      - Search for "Gmail API" → Click Enable.

  3. **Create OAuth Credentials**
      - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
      
      - Click "Create Credentials" → OAuth client ID
      
      - Choose Desktop App.
      
      - Download the credentials.json file.
      
      - Rename it credentials.json and save it in the same directory


4. **Add Your Monero Wallet Address**
      - Use any wallet supported by nanopool.org
        Open `command.txt` and edit the field (Your_wallet_address) with you own wallet address, there are 3 such fields

5. **Add your email**
      - Head to main.py and edit ("your_email") with the email you used for creating the cloud project

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python gmailcode.py
```
The script will:
  - Open up a google auth window
  - Select the account you used to create credentials.json
  - You may get an error of insufficent access, or the dev has not allowed you to access it
  - To fix this, Go to console.cloud.google.com
  - Open your project
  - Go to APIS
  - Then Go to OAuth consent Screen
  - Click on Audience
  - Under Test Users, Click on Add users
  - Fill the email you used for this project
  - Save
  - Now rerun `python gmailcode.py`
  - If Sucessfull, it should save a file named `token.json`

  - Now Run
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  - This will start the program and you should see chromium tab pop up and simulating the login process for you

**OPTIONS**
  - You can edit the num_tabs field if you want more tabs mining ( Do not exceed more than 90% ram consumption, as it may cause forceful inactivity)
  - To check mining progress, head to https://nanopool.org and enter your wallet address in the search field

  20 tabs being run

**NOTE**
**THIS IS AN EXPLOIT AND MAY STOP WORKING IF PATCHED**

## 🧠 How Keep-Alive Works

Instead of sending keystrokes, we inject the following safe JavaScript:
- Scrolls the page slightly up and down
- Focuses the terminal's hidden input field
- Dispatches an `input` event

This keeps the mining sessions alive without disrupting the actual terminal behavior.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Your Gmail credentials are stored locally and securely.
- Never share `credentials.json` or `token.json`.
- Avoid using accounts with 2FA unless you're using app passwords.
